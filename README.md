## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to diagnose breast cancer using the **Random Forest** algorithm. The goal is to classify tumors as **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)** based on digitized image features derived from fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

The project demonstrates a rigorous data science workflow, including data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and model evaluation.
