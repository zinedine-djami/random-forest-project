Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Random Forest 🏥🤖📌 Project OverviewThis project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to diagnose breast cancer using the Random Forest algorithm. The goal is to classify tumors as Malignant (M) or Benign (B) based on digitized image features derived from fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.The project demonstrates a rigorous data science workflow, including data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and model evaluation. It serves as a technical demonstration of ensemble learning techniques in medical diagnostics.📊 DatasetSource: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)Observations: 569 (357 Benign, 212 Malignant)Features: 30 numerical features (Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, etc.)Target: Binary Classification (Malignant/Benign)⚙️ MethodologyData Preprocessing:Missing value inspection.Label Encoding (B=0, M=1).Stratified Train-Test Split (80/20).Feature Scaling using StandardScaler.Model Implementation:Random Forest Classifier with 5-fold Cross-Validation.Gradient Boosting Classifier for performance comparison.Optimization:Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV (tuning n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split).Feature Selection using SelectFromModel (reducing dimensionality based on importance scores).Evaluation:Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Feature Importance Plots.📈 Key ResultsThe optimized Random Forest model achieved robust performance on the test set:MetricScoreAccuracy95.61%ROC-AUC0.99Recall97.22%F1-Score96.55%Top predictors identified: Worst Area, Worst Concave Points, and Worst Radius.🛠️ Technologies UsedPythonScikit-Learn (Modeling & Preprocessing)Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)🚀 How to RunClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-random-forest.git
